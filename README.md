The code for our paper "Large-displacement 3D Object Tracking with Hybrid Non-local Optimization, ECCV'2022".

This repository is mainly for reproducing our main results in the paper. For a real-scene live demo, please see [BoxAR](https://github.com/cvbubbles/BoxAR).

## Installation

The code is developed with vs2019, and can be easily ported to linux.
